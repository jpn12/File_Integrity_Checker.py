# File_Integrity_Checker.py

 <h1>Attention</h1>
As you can see there are 2 files
the first one (FIC.py) you need to put the root dir and the filename when you execute the file and then the program will search for the file
the second (FIC 2.py), you need to edit the file and put in the directory of the file you want to check for integrity
