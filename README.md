 <h1>Attention</h1>
As you can see there are 2 files<br>
the first one (FIC.py) you need to put the root dir and the filename when you execute the file and then the program will search for the file.<br>
the second (FIC 2.py), you need to edit the file and put in the directory of the file you want to check for integrity.<br>
